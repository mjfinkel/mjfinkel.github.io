        <div>
          The Glenbrook South Variety Show is a collection of acts performed by Glenbrook South High School students. As live film director, my job involved working with act directors and studying student-submitted and faculty-organized acts for live film production. It also involved organizing and directing a film crew of camera operators, audio and video technicians, and assistant directors. After filming, I led and assisted a team of video editors to prepare the final cut of the show. The 2021 show was different from other years, as the COVID-19 regulations restricted in-person shows, causing more reliace on the video screening than ever before.

          During the COVID-19 pandemic, Glenbrook South High School needed a way to introduce its incoming freshman to the school environment and layout virtually. I was asked by the school administrators to schedule, film, and edit this project. This video combines clips of the interior of the school with explanations from existing students in the background. Other students and I completed all of this efficiently while abiding by COVID-19 regulations.

          For the final project of my school's TV & Film class, I produced a commercial for RAZER gaming products. This project won first place at the 2020 Midwest Media Educators Association (MMEA) Film Festival, regarded by my high school and many others to be both the state and regional-level of competition for high school students. I led production and editing on this two-man project.
